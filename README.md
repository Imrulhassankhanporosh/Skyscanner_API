This is a test automation project where test cases are implemented on the Skyscanner API using RestAssured, TestNG as the test framework, and Java as the programming language. There are 5 endpoints, and all my 
test cases are based on those endpoints of the Skyscanner API. My test cases ensure comprehensive coverage of our REST API testing and validate its functionality and reliability. The test cases include HTTP 
method testing, API error handling, content validation, etc. I used valid input data to ensure expected behavior and used invalid input data to validate error handling. I tried to implement the majority of 
test cases in this automation project to make the testing more efficient and faster. 35 out of 65 test cases have been executed successfully in this test automation project which includes 29 pass cases and 
6 fail cases.
